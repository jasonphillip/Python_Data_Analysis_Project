Tech Layoffs 
Coded by: Jason Phillip <Jason.Phillip@gmail.com>

Starting in the second half of 2022 the news has been filled with layoffs in the tech industry.  Is this because companies are going out of business or are they just reducing their staff that swelled when the world shifted to WFH. My project is an attempt to answer this question by looking at the data. I'll be analyzing and creating visuals with the dataset from the website layoffs.fyi which has been keeping track of company layoff announcements since the beginning of 2020.  It has several important variables such as the layoff date, company name, industry, percent of company workforce laid off, and investment stage of the company.
